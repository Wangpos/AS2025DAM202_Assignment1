## Abstract

This study implements and evaluates three word embedding methodologies (Word2Vec, FastText, and GloVe) on the IMDB movie review corpus to demonstrate domain-specific embedding training and comprehensive evaluation frameworks. The research addresses the need for specialized embeddings in sentiment analysis tasks, comparing architectural approaches through both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation metrics. Results demonstrate that FastText achieves superior performance (86.9% accuracy) in sentiment classification tasks due to its subword information handling, while Word2Vec provides optimal computational efficiency with comparable semantic understanding. The implementation successfully optimizes for resource-constrained environments (M2 MacBook Air, 8GB RAM) while maintaining academic rigor through statistical validation and reproducible methodology.

## 1. Introduction and Domain Motivation

### 1.1 Research Objectives

The proliferation of user-generated content in the digital entertainment industry necessitates sophisticated natural language processing capabilities for understanding and analyzing movie reviews. This research investigates the effectiveness of domain-specific word embeddings trained on movie review corpora compared to general-purpose embeddings, addressing critical questions in specialized semantic representation learning.

### 1.2 Domain-Specific Requirements

Movie reviews present unique linguistic characteristics that justify custom embedding training:

**Specialized Vocabulary**: Film reviews contain domain-specific terminology including cinematographic concepts (mise-en-sc√®ne, montage), genre-specific language (suspenseful, comedic), and industry jargon (box office, ratings, awards) that may be underrepresented in general corpora.

**Context-Dependent Sentiment**: Terms like "slow" can indicate thoughtful pacing (positive) or boring execution (negative) depending on context, requiring domain-aware semantic representations to capture nuanced sentiment expressions.

**Informal Register**: Contemporary reviews frequently employ colloquialisms, creative metaphors, and internet slang that differ significantly from formal text corpora typically used for general embeddings.

**Temporal and Cultural Context**: Movie reviews reference contemporary events, other films, and cultural phenomena, creating semantic relationships specific to entertainment discourse.

### 1.3 Research Questions

1. **Domain Adaptation Effectiveness**: Do domain-specific embeddings outperform general-purpose embeddings for movie review analysis tasks?

2. **Architectural Comparison**: How do different embedding architectures (Word2Vec, FastText, GloVe) perform across intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation metrics in the movie review domain?

3. **Resource Optimization**: Can high-quality embeddings be trained effectively on consumer hardware with memory constraints?

## 2. Data Collection and Preprocessing

### 2.1 Dataset Selection and Characteristics

**Source**: IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews  
**License**: Public domain dataset widely used in academic research  
**URL**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews  
**Corpus Composition**: 50,000 reviews (25,000 positive, 25,000 negative sentiments)

The dataset provides balanced sentiment distribution ensuring unbiased training and evaluation. Review lengths vary from brief sentences to extensive analyses, capturing the full spectrum of user-generated content in the movie review domain.

### 2.2 Preprocessing Strategy

The implementation employs a dual preprocessing pipeline addressing different model requirements:

#### 2.2.1 Preprocessing Pipeline Architecture

**Neural Network Preprocessing** (`custom_standardization`):

- HTML artifact removal (`<br />` tags, entities)
- Character filtering (alphanumeric retention only)
- Single character elimination (excluding meaningful instances)
- Whitespace normalization
- WordNet lemmatization for morphological standardization

**Embedding-Optimized Preprocessing** (`preprocess_for_embeddings`):

- Selective HTML tag removal while preserving content structure
- Strategic punctuation retention (sentiment indicators: !, ?, -, .)
- Contextual character filtering preserving meaningful single characters ('I', 'a')
- Tokenization with semantic boundary preservation
- Selective lemmatization maintaining contextual variations

#### 2.2.2 Preprocessing Justifications

**Domain-Specific Decisions**:

- **Punctuation Preservation**: Exclamation marks and question marks carry significant sentiment weight in movie reviews
- **Lemmatization Strategy**: Reduces vocabulary size while preserving semantic distinctions
- **HTML Handling**: Structured removal prevents training on formatting artifacts
- **Case Normalization**: Standardizes input while preserving information content

**Memory Optimization**:

- Stratified sampling (25,000 reviews) maintaining sentiment balance
- Batch processing with adaptive sizing for memory management
- Real-time memory monitoring preventing system overload

### 2.3 Corpus Statistics

**Final Preprocessing Results**:

- Total sentences: 25,000 (balanced positive/negative)
- Total tokens: 4,167,234
- Unique vocabulary: 54,670 words
- Average sentence length: 166.7 words
- Vocabulary coverage: Comprehensive domain-specific terminology

## 3. Model Choices and Justification

### 3.1 Embedding Architecture Selection

Three complementary embedding approaches were selected to provide comprehensive comparison across different theoretical foundations:

#### 3.1.1 Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013)

**Theoretical Foundation**: Local context window prediction using neural networks
**Architecture**: Skip-gram model optimized for smaller, domain-specific corpora
**Justification**: Provides fast training baseline with strong semantic similarity capture

**Advantages**:

- Computational efficiency enabling rapid experimentation
- Strong performance on word similarity tasks
- Well-established theoretical foundation with extensive empirical validation

**Limitations**:

- Cannot handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words
- No subword information utilization
- Limited to local context information

#### 3.1.2 FastText (Bojanowski et al., 2017)

**Theoretical Foundation**: Extension of Word2Vec incorporating character n-gram information
**Architecture**: Skip-gram with subword enrichment (n-grams 3-6)
**Justification**: Addresses OOV handling critical for noisy movie review text

**Advantages**:

- Robust handling of misspellings and informal language
- Generates embeddings for unseen words through character composition
- Maintains Word2Vec efficiency while adding morphological awareness

**Limitations**:

- Increased memory requirements due to subword vocabulary
- Longer training time compared to standard Word2Vec
- Potential noise from character n-gram information

#### 3.1.3 GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014)

**Theoretical Foundation**: Global co-occurrence matrix factorization
**Architecture**: Weighted least squares optimization on word-word co-occurrence statistics
**Justification**: Leverages global corpus statistics for comprehensive semantic relationships

**Advantages**:

- Utilizes global statistical information beyond local contexts
- Excellent performance on word analogy tasks
- Theoretically grounded in matrix factorization principles

**Limitations**:

- Higher memory requirements for co-occurrence matrix storage
- Computational complexity in matrix construction phase
- Less robust to noisy text compared to neural approaches

### 3.2 Model Selection Rationale

The selection of all three methods enables comprehensive comparison across different embedding paradigms:

- **Local vs. Global**: Word2Vec/FastText (local contexts) vs. GloVe (global statistics)
- **Subword Awareness**: FastText (character-aware) vs. Word2Vec/GloVe (word-level)
- **OOV Handling**: FastText (subword composition) vs. others (vocabulary limited)
